		<h2>Why Am I Doing This?</h2>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			A wise [wo]man once said "Ever since I was child, I have longed to turn unstructured data into actionable business insights." <br/>
		   	Though my own passion for data cleanliness did not awaken until I was nearly 15, I agree with that sentiment wholeheartedly.<br/>
			Therefore, my purpose for enrolling in Lindner is to turn myself into the ideal business machine, which will shake my corner of the information world to its very core.

		<h2>When I Grow Up, I Want to Be...</h2>
		<p>
			On advice of counsel, I wish to state that my only career goal is to remain at the University of Cincinnati for as long as humanly possible, and that I have no ambitions outside of the insitution which has so generously nourished me and allowed me to feed myself and my family.<br/><br/>
			In service of this, I hope to one day possess the skill set to better plan and implement complex data systems, leaving them in the best possible state for any who might come after me.

		<h2>May I Interest You In...</h2>
		<h3>A Brief History of Flemish Accounting?</h3>
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Shield_of_the_Flemish_Legion.svg/1024px-Shield_of_the_Flemish_Legion.svg.png" height="150x"/>
		<p>
			I wasn't joking about having a passion for accounting. Though I could never parlay this into a career -- both because this is the sort of passion that would not survive a 9-5, and also because there are few people clamoring for pre-modern accountancy -- it is still something that I greatly enjoy learning about. <br/>
			These are articles I have found particularly enjoyable:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"Researches of Raymond de Roover in Flemish Accounting of the Fourteenth Century" by Lewis A Carman (<a href="https://egrove.olemiss.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1821&context=jofa">link</a>)</li>
			<li>"Accounting prescription and practice in ninteenth-century France. An analysis of bankruptcy cases" by Pierre Labardin (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21552851.2011.616717">link</a>)</li>
			<li>"Before Budgeting" by Kevin Hawickhorst (<a href="https://www.statecapacitance.pub/p/before-budgeting">link</a>)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Gene Wolfe</h3>
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Gene_Wolfe%2C_2005.png"/>
		<p>
			If you're interested in science fiction, the best pitch for Gene Wolfe is that your favorite author probably loves him.<br/>
			While he never achieved the level of household success of Asimov or LeGuin (or perhaps his revival hasn't yet come?), he was an indispensible presence in the late 20th century literary sci-fi scene.<br/>
			And, if sci-fi isn't your thing, he was also a P&G company man who was responsible for the Pringles machine (and potentially the inspiration for the brand's logo).<br/>
			Again, here are some works you may find interesting:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"Forlesen" (1974) - A story about the surreal and institutional nature of a beloved Cincinnati business</li>
			<li><i>The Fifth Head of Cerberus</i> (1982) - A puzzle box in three parts.</li>
			<li><i>Soldier of the Mist</i> (1986) - One of the best historical (+myth) novels I have read, written as the diary of an amnesiac in Classical Greece.</li>
			<li>"December Twenty-Fourth Nineteen Fifty-Five" (1988) - A poem written for his wife about the day specified. 
		</ul>
